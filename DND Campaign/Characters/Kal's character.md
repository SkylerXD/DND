Items: 

Gun:A sniper rifle, a long range weapon that has a 100+ range scope, can be used to simply see further away as well, somewhat of a 'magical' item, holds a bullet, silent when shot. Able to charge and fire an arcane bullet titled "Ray Shot." Which is effective, and if the weapon doesn't kill will cause an electric shock to go through the body of whomever is shot. The bullet itself must charge in the chamber for 4 'turns' so it holds the magical element well enough to fire without exploding mid-air.

When using this item there will always be a kick, causing a minus 2-3 hp when shot due to the sheer force of the weapon alone.

  
  
Personality: 

  

Most would consider Caine to be a good person, he values his family over anything, and runs a decent establishment in Coasith. Those who know him outside of his appearance and know him from the fighting arena know him to be a cunning elf who actively gets in the mind of others to gain an advantage in a brawl. Even so, he's a talented boxer and a good-hearted man. Caine is a caring person who is always willing to protect those that need his help.  Caine is apathetic to honor,excitable, mischievous and, above all else, loyal.  though he tends to be indifferent toward morality and will often screw over higher ups to gain something and better his situation for himself.

  

Appearance:

Caine appears to be thirty-five to early forties. His skin is dark, nearly obsidian in color with gold accents on his pointed ears and soft freckles adorn his cheeks and knuckles. His eyes are a vibrant red, often shining slightly amongst his dark skin. His hair is dark grey, white streaks appear on his beard. His build goes beyond toned muscle structure and verges into defined, well built curves often visible through most of his clothing. Muscles strain against fabric at the forearms, biceps and chest. Caine's body is almost entirely covered in ink, and some tattoos of his are there to remind him of what he lost, and why it's important to him. Some of them telling his story, others being purely aesthetic, specific ones used as a warning to his enemies, and more of them to represent significant kills. A large, still prominent scar lies upon his shoulder, the ridges of what appears to be an old bite wound from a beast still semi-bright in color. His arms are adorned in sleeves of tattoos, some symbols, some words most cannot read.

Backstory: 

As a child, Caine never realized how unusual the phantoms at the edge of the undercity were. He'd see them standing out among the allies; black figures, like large humanoids draped in long sheets with two glowing eyes, doing nothing. 

He stopped mentioning them to his parents, who dismissed it as an overactive imagination, but they were always there. He grew up sheltered from the wider world, having grown up in Coasith, his parents keeping him inside as often as they could. 

Throughout his childhood, Caine’s mother and father ran their own shop and were always proud of that. He grew up working with them, but they always told him that the greatest achievement in life was finding his own place in society. Though they managed to earn enough to remain comfortable, early on he realized that they were not in the most lucrative business and that there was greater coin to be made doing something else.

As he got older though, it occurred to him that the figures he’d seen as a child had never hurt anyone, and despite their menacing appearance, had never really brought harm. In young adulthood, Caine decided that he’d approach them for the first time. 

On that day, his parents were running the shop, he had time. Slowly he walked through the city, and when he looked upon them, one of them raised an arm, beckoned him forward, and then turned to leave. All the figures simultaneously turned and moved further into the city's alleyways, and once at the tunnel entrances, they continued into the tunnels themselves, expecting him to follow.

So he did. The tunnels were polluted, the stream at his feet dirtied by oils, chemicals, and scrap metal and covered in bolts and abandoned rifle parts. Even in the tunnel, everything seemed too dark. Even with the slight glow from the polluted stream, it was still dark. Darker than it should’ve been. But Caine was an arrogant young elf, so he pressed on, further into the tunnel depths, the figures' wispy bodies still moving forward. 

Feeling as though he was falling behind he quickened his pace, still mindlessly following these figures, they seemed kind enough. However, his thoughts were quickly shut down when a low rumble emanated from the dark abyss before him,  just beyond the shaded people before him. The boy halted instantaneously, fear weighing his feet in place.

 The shadowed figures shifted to the tunnel walls, the now dimly lit area revealing a beast that Caine had never seen. From the shadows comes a canine, yet it's no ordinary predator. With this monster there came a musky scent tinctured with rancid breath. It was staring with almost human eyes. Its built frame hunched forward, looming over the elf. The only sound in the entire tunnel was its breathing, the beast flaring its nostrils as it took in Caine’s scent. 

It curled up its gums to reveal yellow-stained teeth and then let out another low rumbling growl. Caine is sure he already knows his fate, in seconds his throat will be ripped out, his flesh consumed, and blood staining the walls of the polluted tunnel he foolishly wandered into. In the split seconds it takes this beast to examine the boy, Caine runs. 

  
  
  

The boy returns home, and upon opening the door he sees his mother, a drow named Ellinior, being held by his father, her sobs echoing through their home. Caine shifts his gaze to meet his fathers, a high elf named Alen. His gaze softens and immediately he’s embraced by both of them. Though, it’s not long before his mother takes notice of the wound that throbbed painfully through his torn shirt. A bite wound, the gashes leaking blood like a faucet, with a faint green color infecting his dark skin just around the bite. To this day he’s guilted by his foolishness to follow those draped figures in the city allies to that tunnel. 

  
  
  

 Weeks went by while the boy was bedridden, his wound not yet healed but his aggression at an all-time high. Even so, he did his best to aid his beloved parents around the house as they worked. Despite his clouded mind, he thought heavily about the future, though most of his ideas required some seed money, and the best business owners are the ones who know their clientele, he learned that through working in his family shop and meeting his good friend Ekko through it, so he took up the life of an adventurer. Seeking to invest in others, start his own, and grow a business. 

  
  
  

Years passed and his mother and father were proud of Caine, who now, runs a bar in Coasith. The pub or well, the nightclub is locally known for its neon lighting and underground fighting arena that many patrons bet on. The building consists of three floors connected by several spiral staircases with vaulted ceilings and an elevator that leads to the lower level. Carved metal embedded around neon lights and engraved marble pillars make up most of the building's outer structure. 

It's a large building, three stories, and about 80 feet square. Fancy thick curtains cover the tall stained-glass windows, and upbeat music spills out into the street. Polished, metal beams support the upper floor and the ambient lights that are suspended from them. The walls are plastered with pictures of all sorts and sizes. 

Some are from nearby towns or provinces, others from the far corners of the world, all apparently posted by patrons. High-backed chairs surround round tables, and employees dressed in punk-like outfits move from table to table pouring liquor of all kinds, most brightly colored into varying glasses, all bearing the bar’s neon-colored sigil. 

The center of the room is a dance floor where a quartet plays an upbeat tune. The owner, none other than Caine himself. He often greets patrons before turning to the elevator to the lower level. Aristocrats and their Sorcerous bodyguards often reside on upper floors, all still decked out in neon-accented clothes.

 In fact, many notice there is a guardsman seated at each of the tables, and standing near the curved mahogany staircase leading to the second-floor chambers. Those chambers consist of several large rooms with beds and feather mattresses—dim purple lighting in each of the sleeping quarters. 

Taking the elevator into the lower level, patrons take note of how much blood is on the metal walls, though carved delicately the room is illuminated by neon lights, dangling from the ceiling, and much heavier music playing from the bar, where Caine spends his time. A charming smile on his face as he serves drinks and takes bets from the patrons. 

Oftentimes he’ll be the one to break the fight up between the brawlers if it gets too out of hand. Though even as Caine works in his bar, he’ll see the shadowed figures again, motioning him onward, beckoning him to that damned tunnel.
