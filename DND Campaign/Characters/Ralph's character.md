Backstory: I woke up outside a bar with piss in my pants and an ache in my head with no memory of who or where I am. All I could gleem from my shattered mind was that my name is Dankle Kang. I asked the bouncer what happened and I was apparently thrown out for being too rowdy. When they threw me out I must have hit my head and almost died because my bowels released and I shit myself and pissed. It also gave me amnesia. I still had all my motor functions and most of the information but I couldn't remember the who or the what or the where in my memory. I knew how to survive and the best way to skin a beast or cast spells but I can't tell you who my mother is.
