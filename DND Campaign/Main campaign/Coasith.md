$\qquad$Also known as the Undercity, Coasith is the slums of the city , becoming almost literally the catch basin of the waste from the city above it where its residents try to survive from scraps spared to them. Even though technically the city is under the governance of Bleakridge, Coasith has been ‘separated’ and left behind by the city leaders. While Bleakridge prospers, the undercity is perpetually riddled with crime and so heavily polluted, its water sources that run through its center now a neon green due to chemical spills, its air is significantly denser than the rest of Bleakridge- its said that those not native to Coasith need to wear gas masks when visiting. The governor deemed the ‘undercity’ dangerous. This has caused a great divide between Coasith and the remainder of Bleakridge, enough to irk citizens of Coasith to want independence from the rest of the city. Due to the lack of government approved supervision, Coasith is run by a separate group deemed The Barons, who keep a deathgrip over their people and insure they are safe, and sheltered from the ‘harm’ of the overcity scum. While also dealing chemicals and illegal guns and spare parts through trade routes hosted in the undercities deepest tunnels.
